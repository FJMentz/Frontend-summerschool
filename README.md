# TheRealApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.0.0.

This project is just a space where I do all my demo's and serves to be an example if anyone needs a recap.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate module module-name` to generate a new module.
Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also add the flag `-m=module-name` to declare the component in a specific module.

You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.
